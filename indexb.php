<p>Welcome to the British Go Association League Website which has now completed its first
season and is well into its second.</p>
<p>The British Go Association League Tournament was originally a team-based Go league
designed to be played mainly over the Internet. Following the success of this, an individual
league is to be introduced as well in January 2011 (with a trial version running
currently).</p>
<p>The purpose of the league is to encourage interaction between players
in different areas of the country and to encourage online play amongst members of the BGA.</p>
<p>To learn more about the league, click <a href="aboutus.php" target="_top">here</a>.
</p>
<p>We congratulate the <b>Cambridge Team</b> on winning the first season championship.</p>
