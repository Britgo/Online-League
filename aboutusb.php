The British Go Association League Tournaments are a pair of Go leagues designed to be
played mainly over the Internet.
The purpose of the league is to encourage interaction between players in
different areas of the country and to encourage online play amongst members of the BGA.
</p>
<p>The league was originally a just team-based league, but following the success of this
an individual league will be introduced in addition from October 2010.</p>
<p>
The league is played in six-monthly seasons for both the team and individual leagues,
starting in October and April.
</p>
<p>In the team league, teams of up to six players may enter the
tournament, and are assigned to league divisions of six or seven teams.
Each season, teams play a round robin tournament within their league.
</p>
<p>In the individual league, players are assigned to a division of roughly the same
standard of players and play each other on a "self-pairing" basis. Players may play each
other as often as they like but are encouraged to play as many different opponents as
they can within their division.
</p>
Games are played online on the <a href="http://www.gokgs.com" target="_blank">KGS Go Server</a>
in the "British Room".
</p>
<p>
The winners in each league division are promoted at the end of the season,
whilst losers face relegation to the league below. There may be more promotions or
relegations in the individual league, depending upon numbers.
The champions of the top division will win the League Tournament Shield.
</p>
<p>A full description of the league, as originally devised, with details of how to form teams and join, can be found
<a href="http://league.britgo.org/doc/LeagueDescription.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,
however it has been adjusted a little in practice and the full description of
playing games is to be found <a href="playing.php" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to form a team, please contact the Online League coordinators at online-league at britgo.org.
Players wishing to captain a team must be members of the British Go Association,
which can be joined <a href="http://www.britgo.org/join" target="_blank">here</a>.
Non-members can join teams at an extra cost.
As the league is intended to mainly link to clubs,
please try to form teams from locally-based players.
</p>
<p>If you would like to play in the individual league, first get an account if you don't have
one. You should have the same account if you play in both leagues and set your
account as being active in the individual league. You can get an account online
using <a href="newacct.php" target="_top">this page</a>.
You will be given a user id and a password.
You can set the password to your own choice of characters later. Please set the contact
details, including your email address (which will never be given out indiscriminately), KGS name, on your account.
</p>
<p>You can see the current team league status
