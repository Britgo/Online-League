The British Go Association League Tournament is a team-based Go league designed to be
played mainly over the Internet.
The purpose of the league is to encourage interaction between players in
different areas of the country and to encourage online play amongst members of the BGA.
</p>
<p>
The league is played in six-monthly seasons, starting in October and April respectively.
Teams of up to six players may enter the tournament, and are assigned to leagues of six
teams. Each season, teams play a round robin tournament within their league.
Games are played online on the <a href="http://www.gokgs.com" target="_blank">KGS Go Server</a>.
</p>
<p>
The winners in each league are promoted at the end of the season,
whilst losers face demotion to the league below.
The champions of the top division will win the League Tournament Cup.
</p>
<p>A full description of the league, as originally devised, with details of how to form teams and join, can be found
<a href="http://league.britgo.org/doc/LeagueDescription.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,
however it has been adjusted a little in practice and the full description of
playing games is to be found <a href="playing.php" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to form a team, please contact the Online League coordinators at online-league at britgo.org.
Players wishing to captain a team must be members of the British Go Association,
which can be joined <a href="http://www.britgo.org/join" target="_blank">here</a>.
Non-members can join teams at an extra cost.
As the league is intended to mainly link to clubs,
please try to form teams from locally-based players.
