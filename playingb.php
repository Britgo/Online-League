<h1>Playing games on the league</h1>
<p>We'd like to clarify how games should be played on the league to avoid confusion.
</p>
<p>Games should be played with the following parameters on KGS
</p>
<ul>
<li>AGA Rules</li>
<li>No handicap</li>
<li>Free Game</li>
<li>Colours assigned <u>as specified in the match allocation</u> not according to strengths
of players</li>
<li>Byo-Yomi time control</li>
<li>Main time 30 minutes</li>
<li>Byo-Yomi time 30 seconds</li>
<li>5 Byo-Yomi periods</li>
<li>Indicate that it's a BGA League Game</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a correct setting for "Custom Game" which should be in
the British Room:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/gamesetup.png" width="348" height="469" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="20" alt="KGS Go Screen">
</div>
<p>Please try to stick to the colours as they are assigned WBW or BWB to boards 1 to 3
regardless of strengths. One player
may have to click the button next to his name to get the colours right.</p>
<p>We suggest a "Free Game" as the KGS handicaps are ignored and in some cases wildly different
strength players meet with non-standard handicaps
and we don't think this should confuse KGS rankings.</p>
<p>If you suddenly realise during the game you've got the game settings wrong you can either
opt to continue or discount the game and replay it later, unless the colours are wrong when it
should always be replayed.
</p>
<p>If there is an unavoidable interruption such as one player is disconnected or KGS crashes,
please try to resume it or agree the result by one side resigning possibly in consultation
with an agreed adjudicator.</p>
